# appstore

just simply run `./start.sh`. It will build docker image with necessary dependencies, start backend server and frontend server, which then will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/

additionally, opening a seperate terminal to run `./shell.sh` will enter you into the docker environment, where you can run `python init.py` to create a blank database, and `python seed_data.py` to simulate all expected interactions that would happen in an appstore
